# Simplest Website Boiler plate on GitHub
Most web app project templates today are filled with lines upon lines of worthless code you have to deal with before you can get your test site customized for you. 

This repo is not one of those. 

This is the most simple, barebones HTML/CSS/JS boilerplate I could make while still keeping example code in each file.

## Use Cases

Almost anytime I want to test out some new designs, simple static sites, or start a new project, this boiler plate is the place to start.

No BS. Simple code. What you see is what you get. Literally.
